	<p>Mohammad Abdus Salam in 1987</p>

	<h2>Introduction:</h2>
	<p>Mohammad Abdus Salam (29 January 1926 – 21 November 1996) was a Pakistani theoretical physicist. He shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics with Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg for his contribution to the electroweak unification theory. He was the first Pakistani to receive a Nobel Prize in science and the second from an Islamic country to receive any Nobel Prize (after Anwar Sadat of Egypt).</p>
	<h2>Contributions: </h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Two-component neutrino theory and the prediction of the inevitable parity violation in weak interaction</li>

			<li>Gauge unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions, the unified force is called the "Electroweak" force, a name given to it by Salam, and which forms the basis of the Standard Model in particle physics</li>

			<li>Predicted the existence of weak neutral currents, and W and Z bosons, before their experimental discovery</li>

			<li>Symmetry properties of elementary particles</li>

			<li>Renormalisation of meson theories</li>

			<li>Gravity theory and its role in particle physics; two tensor theory of gravity and strong interaction physics</li>

			<li>Unification of electroweak with strong nuclear forces, grand unification theory</li>

			<li>Related prediction of proton-decay</li>

			<li>Pati–Salam model, a grand unification theory</li>

			<li>Supersymmetry theory, in particular formulation of Superspace and formalism of superfields in 1974</li>

			<li>The theory of supermanifolds, as a geometrical framework for understanding supersymmetry, in 1974</li>

			<li>Supergeometry, the geometric basis for supersymmetry, in 1974</li>

			<li>Application of the Higgs mechanism to 'electroweak symmetry breaking</li>

			<li>Prediction of the magnetic photon in 1966</li>
